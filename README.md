# Algorithms for solving maximum flow problem

Maximum flow problems are a group of important and well-studied optimization
problems and they involve finding a feasible flow through a single-source, single-sink flow network that is maximum. This repository is an implementation solving a single source and sink flow problem. Two most popular methods are implemented : [Ford-Fulkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford–Fulkerson_algorithm) method and [Push-relabel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push–relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm) generic algorithm. Implemetation is in C++.

## Prerequisites
